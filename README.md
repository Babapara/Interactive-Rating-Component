### What I learned
As a newbie into javascript i had some tough times with regards to the process of getting user rating on one page and displaying it on the other page. It seemed like a huge mountain at first site.
So i learnt the use of LocalStorage, the use of conditionality as regards to events practically and most importantly getting results based on user input.
